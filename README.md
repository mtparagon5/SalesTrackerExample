# SalesTrackerExample

This is a sample program I wrote to help someone track a few sales data points they are interested in. It accomplishes the following:
  - allows the user to add multiple date specific sales data 
  - add said data to a datagrid to view in table format
  - save the data to multiple files allowing for organization into day, week, month, year, and master format, as well as a backup of the master
  - record log of use

The next step will be to use either pandas, highcharts, or one of the other visualization and analytics tools to create a small dashboard for quick review of useful data points.
